      %h3 Tag or Be Tagged
      %p Assign tags to your contacts or, if you see one there you agree with, vouch a tag they've already been given. GiveBrand is powered by people, not algorithms: The more people tag you, the higher your credibility.

      %p If a single word or phrase isn't enough for a tag to speak for itself, add a short, Twitter-style endorsement to explain a tag you've given them. Anyone who visits their profile will be able to see it.
